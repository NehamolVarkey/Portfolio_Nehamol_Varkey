| ------------ | ------------| 
| <a href="https://github.com/NehamolVarkey/Traffic_Flow_Prediction">AI Based Traffic Flow Prediction🚗</a><br> | "AI Based Traffic Flow Prediction" dives deep into detecting and tracking cars in a video feed. It utilizes a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model to detect cars in each frame of the video. The detected bounding boxes are then processed using non-maximum suppression to remove redundant detections. The CentroidTracker class is used to associate detections across frames and track the movement of cars. Additionally, it keeps count of the number of cars and records their entry time into a CSV file. Overall, it showcases the application of computer vision for real-world object detection and tracking tasks.<br><p><ul>Tools Used🛠️:<br><li>Programming Language: Python<br></li><li>Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, pandas, imutils, non_max_suppression_fast, CentroidTracker<br></li><li>IDE: VSCode<br></li></ul></p> |

| Project Link | Description |
| ------------ | ------------| 
| <a href="https://github.com/NehamolVarkey/EDA-wheat-production">Exploratory Data Analysis on Wheat Production in India🌾</a><br> | The Wheat Production in India Project showcases how much wheat is produced by different states in India around 50 years, using Python and libraries like Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn and Matplotlib, within the Jupyter Notebook environment. It explores how much area is used for wheat cultivation and which all states cultivate wheat.<br><p><ul>Tools Used🛠️:<br><li>Programming Language: Python<br></li><li>Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn<br></li><li>IDE: Jupyter Notebook<br></li></ul></p> |

| ------------ | ------------| 
| <a href="https://github.com/NehamolVarkey/House_Price_Prediction">House Price Prediction and Analysis🏠</a><br> | House Price Prediction and Analysis exhibit an overview of a Python script for analyzing house price data using linear regression. The project begins with data preprocessing steps. Following preprocessing, the project splits the data into training and testing sets, performs feature scaling, and fits a linear regression model to the training data. Predictions are made on the test set, and the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. Hence, predict the house prices by analyzing the dataset, building a regression model, and evaluate its performance.<br><p><ul>Tools Used🛠️:<br><li>Programming Language: Python<br></li><li>Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn<br></li><li>IDE: PyCharm</li></p>| 
| <a href="https://github.com/NehamolVarkey/Stroke_Prediction">Stroke Prediction: Comparative Analysis of Classification Algorithms🧠</a><br> | The Stroke Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of strokes in individuals based on various health-related factors. It trains multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. The performance of each model is evaluated in terms of accuracy and execution time. By visualizing the results using seaborn, the project offers insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of different algorithms in predicting strokes, providing valuable information for healthcare professionals and policymakers.<br><p><ul>Tools Used🛠️:<br><li>Programming Language: Python<br></li><li>Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn<br></li><li>IDE: PyCharm</li></p> |

| Project Link | Description |
| ------------ | ------------| 
| <a href="https://github.com/NehamolVarkey/Sentiment_Analysis">Voice Emotion Analyzer with Sentiment Analysis🎙️</a><br> | "Voice Emotion Analyzer with Sentiment Analysis" implements a Python GUI application called "Admin Home" using Tkinter. It allows users to record and analyze audio files, providing real-time sentiment analysis using the VADER sentiment analyzer from NLTK. Users can record voice input, select audio files for analysis, and view sentiment analysis results categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. The application offers an intuitive interface for recording, selecting, and analyzing audio content.<br><p><ul>Tool used🛠️:<br><li>Programming Language: Python<br></li><li>Libraries: Tkinter, Sounddevice, Scipy, NLTK, SpeechRecognition, MySQL Connector<br></li><li>IDE: PyCharm<br></li></ul></p>| 

<h1><a name="facialrecognition">Facial Recognition</a></h1>

| Project Link | Description |
| ------------ | ------------| 
| <a href="https://github.com/NehamolVarkey/Face_Detection">Automated Face Recognition Attendance System👨🏼‍🦱</a><br> | "Automated Face Recognition Attendance System" project develops a face recognition attendance system with features like checking the camera, capturing images, training face recognition models, and logging attendance. It includes functions for real-time face recognition using a webcam, training the recognition model, and capturing images for training. Additionally, it features a graphical admin interface for tasks like recording voice and analyzing emotions. This comprehensive system provides solutions for face recognition-based attendance tracking, making it suitable for various applications.<br><p><ul>Tools Used🛠️:<br><li>Programming Language: Python<br></li><li>Libraries: os, OpenCV, pandas, numpy, PIL, time, datetime<br></li><li>IDE: PyCharm<br></li></ul></p> |
