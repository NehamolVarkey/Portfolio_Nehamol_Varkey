| <a href="https://github.com/NehamolVarkey/Traffic_Flow_Prediction">AI Based Traffic Flow Prediction🚗</a><br> | "AI Based Traffic Flow Prediction" dives deep into detecting and tracking cars in a video feed. It utilizes a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model to detect cars in each frame of the video. The detected bounding boxes are then processed using non-maximum suppression to remove redundant detections. The CentroidTracker class is used to associate detections across frames and track the movement of cars. Additionally, it keeps count of the number of cars and records their entry time into a CSV file. Overall, it showcases the application of computer vision for real-world object detection and tracking tasks.<br><p><ul>Tools Used🛠️:<br><li>Programming Language: Python<br></li><li>Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, pandas, imutils, non_max_suppression_fast, CentroidTracker<br></li><li>IDE: VSCode<br></li></ul></p> |

| ------------ | ------------| 
| <a href="https://github.com/NehamolVarkey/EDA-wheat-production">Exploratory Data Analysis on Wheat Production in India🌾</a><br> | The Wheat Production in India Project showcases how much wheat is produced by different states in India around 50 years, using Python and libraries like Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn and Matplotlib, within the Jupyter Notebook environment. It explores how much area is used for wheat cultivation and which all states cultivate wheat.<br><p><ul>Tools Used🛠️:<br><li>Programming Language: Python<br></li><li>Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn<br></li><li>IDE: Jupyter Notebook<br></li></ul></p> |

| Project Link | Description |
| ------------ | ------------| 
| <a href="https://github.com/NehamolVarkey/Sentiment_Analysis">Voice Emotion Analyzer with Sentiment Analysis🎙️</a><br> | "Voice Emotion Analyzer with Sentiment Analysis" implements a Python GUI application called "Admin Home" using Tkinter. It allows users to record and analyze audio files, providing real-time sentiment analysis using the VADER sentiment analyzer from NLTK. Users can record voice input, select audio files for analysis, and view sentiment analysis results categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. The application offers an intuitive interface for recording, selecting, and analyzing audio content.<br><p><ul>Tool used🛠️:<br><li>Programming Language: Python<br></li><li>Libraries: mysql.connector, tkinter, sounddevice, scipy.io.wavfile, nltk.sentiment.vader, nltk.tokenize, speech_recognition<br></li><li>IDE: PyCharm<br></li></ul></p>| 

<h1><a name="facialrecognition">Facial Recognition</a></h1>

| Project Link | Description |
| ------------ | ------------| 
| <a href="https://github.com/NehamolVarkey/Face_Detection">Automated Face Recognition Attendance System👨🏼‍🦱</a><br> | "Automated Face Recognition Attendance System" project develops a face recognition attendance system with features like checking the camera, capturing images, training face recognition models, and logging attendance. It includes functions for real-time face recognition using a webcam, training the recognition model, and capturing images for training. Additionally, it features a graphical admin interface for tasks like recording voice and analyzing emotions. This comprehensive system provides solutions for face recognition-based attendance tracking, making it suitable for various applications.<br><p><ul>Tools Used🛠️:<br><li>Programming Language: Python<br></li><li>Libraries: os, OpenCV, pandas, numpy, PIL, time, datetime<br></li><li>IDE: PyCharm<br></li></ul></p> |
